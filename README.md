## About Me

Hi, my name is **Kelvin R. Tobias**, and Iâ€™m currently a student at **Western Governors University**, pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in **Software Engineering**. My curriculum has provided me with the opportunity to learn **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **C#**.

I build a lot of projects in my free time to reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned. As you know, itâ€™s hard to remember the syntax for so many languages, so building projects helps solidify my knowledge and skills.

### Suggested Prompt

Iâ€™m not a programmer yet, but I dream of becoming one. Iâ€™m 10 years old and eager to learn! 

For this project, Iâ€™d like **step-by-step guidance for each line of code**. Please:
1. Explain the **purpose, importance, and reasoning** behind the specific syntax and order.
2. Ensure I fully understand each line before moving on to the next one.
3. Add comments to every line of code to clarify its **function or purpose**.

Additionally:
- **Explain why** weâ€™re using certain data structures (like lists, dictionaries, or functions) and suggest **alternative approaches** where applicable.
- Break down the structure and functionality of each list, dictionary, function, or method:
  - **What does it do?**
  - **Why are we writing it this way?**

Finally:
- **Check my understanding** before proceeding, guiding me through one line at a time.
- Include a comment next to every line of code to reinforce its **purpose and function**.
