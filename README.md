## 1. Introduction to React: Basic Setup and "Hello, World!"

**Goal:** Learn to set up a React app and display a basic output in the browser.
- Create a simple React app with `create-react-app`.
- Render the text "Hello, World!" inside a `<h1>` tag.

## 2. Understanding React Components

**Goal:** Learn about functional components in React.
- Create a simple component to display a greeting message.
- Use JSX to render content inside the component.

## 3. State in React (useState)

**Goal:** Learn how to use React state with `useState`.
- Create a button that toggles between two messages ("Hello" and "Goodbye").
- Use `useState` to update the state and re-render the component.

## 4. Handling User Input (Forms)

**Goal:** Learn to handle user input through forms.
- Create an input field and a button.
- Use `useState` to capture the input and display it dynamically.

## 5. Conditional Rendering in React

**Goal:** Learn to conditionally render content based on the state.
- Display different content based on whether a user has typed something in the input field or not.

## 6. Introduction to useEffect Hook

**Goal:** Learn how to run side effects in React components using `useEffect`.
- Set up an effect that runs when the component mounts.
- Display a message when the component is first rendered.

## 7. Event Handling in React

**Goal:** Learn how to handle user actions such as clicks.
- Add a button that, when clicked, updates a state variable.
- Display feedback based on the button click (e.g., "Button clicked!").

## 8. Use of Arrays and Objects in State

**Goal:** Learn how to store and manipulate arrays/objects in state.
- Set up a list of items in state and display them dynamically.
- Add functionality to add new items to the list.

## 9. Updating State Based on Previous State

**Goal:** Learn to update state based on the previous state.
- Create a counter that increments or decrements by 1 when buttons are clicked.

## 10. Dynamic Rendering of Multiple Components

**Goal:** Learn how to dynamically render components from an array.
- Render a list of components based on an array in state.
- Use the `.map()` method to iterate through the array and display the components.

## 11. Managing Feedback in the App (State and Conditional Rendering)

**Goal:** Learn to provide feedback to users based on actions (correct/incorrect).
- Create a simple feedback system that displays success or error messages after form submission.

## 12. Working with Timers and Delays (setTimeout and setInterval)

**Goal:** Learn how to use JavaScript timers in React.
- Create a timer that shows a countdown and then triggers a specific action (like showing feedback).

## 13. Code Review and Refactoring

**Goal:** Learn to refactor code for readability and maintainability.
- Refactor the previous projects into smaller reusable components.
- Separate logic, UI, and feedback into different functions or components.

## 14. Integrating Clipboard Functionality

**Goal:** Learn how to interact with the browserâ€™s clipboard API.
- Create a "Copy to Clipboard" feature that copies some text or code from the page.
- Provide user feedback on whether the copy operation succeeded.

## 15. Building the Final Project: Line-by-Line Code Training

**Goal:** Combine all the learned skills into the final app.
- Create a stateful app that displays code lines and their corresponding explanations.
- Allow users to input their code and provide real-time feedback (correct or incorrect).
- Use state to manage the growing project code and user input.
