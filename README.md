## About Me

Hi, my name is **Kelvin R. Tobias**, and Iâ€™m currently a student at **Western Governors University**, pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in **Software Engineering**. My curriculum has provided me with the opportunity to learn **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, **REACT** and **C#**.

I build a lot of projects in my free time to reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned. As you know, itâ€™s hard to remember the syntax for so many languages, so building projects helps solidify my knowledge and skills.
